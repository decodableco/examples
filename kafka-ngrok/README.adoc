image::https://rmoff.net/images/2023/11/ngrok02.webp[Overview diagram]

_For details of how this works, see https://rmoff.net/2023/11/01/using-apache-kafka-with-ngrok/[this blog] (and take note of https://rmoff.net/2024/05/03/ngrok-dns-headaches/[possible problems] you might encounter)._

To use this you need to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup[create an ngrok account] and add a file called `.env` in this folder with the following entry:

[source,bash]
----
NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_token>
----

Bring up the Kafka and ngrok stack with

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----

Once up, find out your Kafka broker host/post that is available on the internet:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s localhost:4040/api/tunnels | jq -r '.tunnels[0].public_url' | sed 's/tcp:\/\///g'
----

WARNING: There is **NO SECURITY** defined on this Kafka cluster. Anyone scanning the ngrok address/port may find this and be able to access your data.
